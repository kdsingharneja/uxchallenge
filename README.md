# UX Challenge

## High level requirements from Product Owner:
*Assume these are part of an Minimum Viable Product going out in release 0.1*

Users want an app to increase their vocabulary. They want to learn words and phrasal verbs. For every word/phrase  they are learning, they
want the ability to see its meaning, wheather its a noun, adjective etc, see 2 example of the usage, see more example if they dont get it.
Users also want to see if they have see a word before and number of times they have seen it. User want to simple report on how many words they used.

## Other requirements
- A user screen flow for developers and product owners with wireframes.
- An explanation of designs decisions as if you are getting the buy in of the Product Owners and that their requirements have been met. 
- List out any more assumptions / extra research if any which affected your decisions and explain why you needed to do more research.
- This is a mobile design app. You can use Iphone 6 or Google Nexus view ports as design constraints.

## Bonus points 
- If you can provide a working protype in Invision or website etc. **!! If you are doing this, no need to provide a screen workflow.**
- If you can provide HiFi designs  using iOS 10 or Google Material design specs that will be a plus!
